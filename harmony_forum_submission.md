## Application Type
Product Launch

## ✨ Key Highlights
IWasHere.one is a Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) Framework for the Harmony chain, with multiple applications, including:

- Issue POAPs for events and Harmony DAOs.
- Claim POAPs.
- Digital Identity: display and share your badges.
- POAP Explorer: on-chain analytics for snapshots, airdrops, hiring, etc. See the growing world of POAPs and find synergies between people.

We believe we can create an innovative, fun, professional POAP experience directly on Harmony, one of the leading chains for DAO formation and innovative dApps.

## ⚡ Why AktaryTech?

[AktaryTech](https://aktarytech.com) is a professional Web3 and dApp development agency. We’ve built a talented team, put in-place the best software practices, and committed ourselves to quality and code safety. We’ve helped clients launch automated trading bots, DeFi yield aggregators, lending protocols, developer education tools, on-chain games, and NFT marketplaces. Our skills in the entire Web3 stack are growing with every new project.

Every member of our team is passionate about Web3, participating in ongoing education, conferences, and meetups. POAPs are a big part of this, and Harmony with its immense DAO ecosystem, events and ambitions, is poised to be a leader.

We're based in Austin, Texas, with remote employees around the U.S., and actively hiring new developers. We've recently put a bigger focus on marketing, with new hires and a potential marketing-related acquisition balance our development skills with abilities to find product-market fit (or in Web3, ecosystem-organism fit).

## 🏆 Proposal Ask
**$50,000 USD**

### Metrics for success

- $12K mobilizing AktaryTech's service delivery team to IWasHere.one
- $12K after launching a feature-complete product on Harmony testnet.
- $6K after forming a DAO with 5-out-of-9 multisig with Harmony DAOs.
- $12K after launching on Harmony mainnet.
- $8K after hitting 1K daily active users (with launch video, full PR promotion).

The milestones below explain our usage of funds and timeline. Estimating 8 weeks until Mainnet deployment, 11 weeks until full product launch. To begin work beyond this, we need the first milestone payment up-front. Milestones after that are payable on deliverables.

## 📟 Backend

Harmony has excellent documentation that is a pleasure for developers to use. We've also heard positive developer experience stories that makes our team hopeful.

#### Smart Contracts

They're ERC-721s. We can start by forking this:

> ![](/img/poap-xyz-contracts.png)

#### Tokenomics and Marketplace

To be determined whether IWasHere.one could create sustaining value in a token launch. If it helps sustain the development while providing utility and governance, then fungible and non-fungible tokens available in exchanged and market may be an option as well.

#### 🌱 Revenue Model for Sustainability

POAPs are free to create, issue and claim for small events. POAPs that require large events, large DAO giveways, etc. will pay for our premium version. Mechanism of freemium may be more Web3 based, as in staking a governance token.

We will create this decentralized protocol for Harmony, and we also believe it can be a sustainable business. Many POAP relevant metrics in Web3 are growing including conference attendance, hackathons, DAO meetings, developer education seminars, and more.

The **POAP Explorer** will be an advanced NFT Explorer with the goal of finding individuals and communities that have synergies together. This is DAO-tooling that can be used to find contributors and developers to grow their own ecosystem.

## 🚧 Team's experience

Below are some highlights of our service delivery, with some names obfuscated on this public document.

**Renderz**

We built the backend and frontend of an NFT marketplace that is focused on anime-themed NFTs. The app is a full marketplace, where artists can create and mint NFTs, and sell them on the primary and secondary markets. We used ImmutableX, a zk-STARKS layer 2 of Ethereum for the source for minting and the secondary market provider.

**0x_Nodes**

A unique automated cross-chain yield aggregator. We built the interconnecting architecture for their liquidity terminal. This architecture was a transport layer for interactions between chains. This comprised of Solidity smart contracts and relayers via Node.js, TypeScript and Redis. This app was recently featured on CoinBureau YouTube, who has 2 Million subscribers.

**Hummingbot Connectors**

Hummingbot is an open source algorithmic trading bot for CEXs and DEXs. We built connectors for clients that link Hummingbot's internal trading algorithms with live information from different exchanges. They interact with an exchange's REST API and through real-time interactions via Websockets; such as by gathering order book data and sending and canceling trades. We built connectors for speed in Python, Cython and AsyncIO. The projects we’ve done so far:

- **IDEX**  — connector for a hybrid liquidity platform with an off-chain order book + on-chain AMM
- **System9**  —  a crypto market maker who needed an OSL Exchange connector.

**Client B**

We built a smart contract education for a developer-incentivized blockchain. It’s a free interactive code school that teaches developers how to create their own Cosmwasm contracts and deploy dApps to the network. This app trains devs on the Rust programming language for decentralized applications. We gained experience with Rust, Cosmwasm, and this growing ecosystem of non-EVM products.

**Umee.cc**

We built a beautiful dApp for a cross-chain DeFi hub for lending, borrowing, rates, staking, and interoperability. We built the frontend in React and managed many backend smart contracts and integrations. Our contracts are currently running on a Cosmos-based chain as well as Ethereum Goerli and Kovan testnets. The interface was recently featured on CoinBureau, a YouTube channel with 2 Million followers.

**Client C**

An on-chain game, modeled after a roulette wheel where bets are placed in BNB tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. For game logic, we used Chainlink VRF (Verified Random Function), and Chainlink Keepers for trustless spinning of the wheel. We used the Graph Protocol for indexed user information and Tailwind CSS Framework for the UI theme. Since we have mathematics expertise, we also built the probabilities for the game through Monte Carlo simulations of winning and losing scenarios.

**UniTrade**

We built and designed an system to place limit orders on Uniswap v2. Our React + Web3.js front-end provided an intuitive, user-friendly interface that interacted with the Uniswap contracts and submitted orders to the server process for processing.

**Panvala**

We helped build a protocol for cryptocurrency donation-matching on L2s (Polygon and xDai) using React, EthersJS, Web3.js and Gatsby. This matching fund allows for small contributions with low fees and integrates to existing donation sites.

**Others**

We've worked with other clients such as Universal Music Group, USA Today, Riot Games, Renaissance Learning and Qualcomm.

They gave me other ideas for projects you need as well, like POAPS, Badges, NFT explorers, Multisigs and On-Ramps. We're a full service web3 development shop, and thought that POAPs would be a good start, but please keep us in mind for other applications too! Thank you.
